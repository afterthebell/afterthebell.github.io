<blockquote>What would you do if you were a victim of bullying?</blockquote>
</article>
<article>
<p>
Have you ever been bullied by someone? Or have you ever witnessed bullying, but did nothing to stop it? Or, maybe, have you been the perpetrator of bullying? Have you ever stopped to wonder,
</p>
<blockquote>How would I feel in the other person's shoes?</blockquote>
<p>
Follow our protagonist as they navigate through their school life. Witness their interactions with their classmates, and how other people's words affect them. Help them make the choices that they need, in order to survive school. Decide their destiny, and most importantly, have fun!
</p>
<p>Our game was made in Game Maker, with music composed in BandLab.</p>
